## üìù Overview

This repository contains the [Infrastructure as Code (IaC)](https://github.com/zazathomas/Homelab/tree/main/Infrastructure/) configuration for my homelab. The environment is powered by a combination of Docker-based virtual machines and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), with a strong emphasis on adhering to GitOps principles.  

To ensure a well-organized and efficient setup, I leverage a combination of YAML manifests and Helm charts, orchestrated through Argo CD for streamlined and automated deployments.  

I also plan to document my journey and share insights on my [GitHub](https://github.com/zazathomas/Homelab), showcasing the lessons learned and innovations achieved throughout this project.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Getting Started  

For newcomers to Kubernetes, I have adapted an existing shell script to streamline the [Bootstrapping of k3s with Cilium](https://github.com/zazathomas/Homelab/tree/main/K8s/K3s%2BCilium). This provides a simple and efficient starting point for setting up a lightweight Kubernetes cluster.  

In this repository, I have also implemented a robust DevSecOps pipeline to enhance the security and reliability of the homelab infrastructure. This pipeline integrates **Trufflehog** for secret scanning and **Checkov** for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) security analysis, ensuring adherence to best practices and safeguarding sensitive data.
