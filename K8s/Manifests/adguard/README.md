# Adguard

Picture this: you're surfing the web, minding your own business, when suddenly, bam! An ad pops up, crashing your browser party like an uninvited guest. Enter AdGuard Home, my lowly DNS server, here to save the day! It's like having a trusty bouncer for your network, AdGuard Home, Provides all my local dns needs as well as being a great Ad blocker.
I just ported over the manifest using the docker-compose config I used in my old setup. View the manifest and deploy as you see fit.
