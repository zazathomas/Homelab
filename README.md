Starting of on this repository, I've implemented a DevSecOps pipeline for secrets and IaC scanning using Trufflehog and Checkov respectively. This ensure the security and reliability of my homelab infrastructure.

I bootstrapped this cluster using a shell script. More details ...
I swapped out flannel for Cilium because Why not?!
This simplified the bootstrapping of a resilient Kubernetes cluster.
